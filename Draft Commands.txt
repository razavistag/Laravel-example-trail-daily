 **Composer Installation**

    php composer.phar require intervention/image
Integration in Laravel
ntervention Image has optional support for  [Laravel](http://laravel.com/)  and comes with a  Service Provider and Facades  for easy integration. The  `vendor/autoload.php`  is included by Laravel, so you don't have to require or autoload manually. Just see the instructions below.

After you have installed Intervention Image, open your Laravel config file  `config/app.php`  and add the following lines.

In the  **`$providers`**  array add the service providers for this package.

> Intervention\Image\ImageServiceProvider::class

Add the facade of this package to the **`$aliases`**  array.

> 'Image' => Intervention\Image\Facades\Image::class

Now the Image Class will be auto-loaded by Laravel.
#### Publish configuration in Laravel

> php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Intervention\Image\ImageServiceProviderLaravelRecent"
